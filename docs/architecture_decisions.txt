Persons API:
This service is refactored and isolated to handle all `person` related logic including Create, Read, Update, Delete operations. 
This API is designed as a RESTful service for ease of consumption from the web application.


Connections API:
Also a RESTful service, this api handles the most crucial functionality of Udaconnect and is very likely to receive large amounts of read requests.
Refactoring to its own service allows it scale independently of other services and makes it easier to add more functionality as the application grows.


Locations Event API:
This service is designed to handle the large amount of location data that would be ingested from Udaconnect users. 
Since increased speed and performance is a priority for this service, A GRPC server is selected as the message passing technique due to its use of protocol buffers.
This data is then funneled into Kafka Clusters / Queues as they are suitable for processing and holding large amounts of data.


Locations API:
The locations api acts primarily as a Kafka consumer, it processes the incoming location data from the queue and stores them in the database. 
This service can be horizontally scaled up or down depending on the volume of location data being received by the queue.
